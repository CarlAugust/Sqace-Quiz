Hello, if your for some reason reading this, you are welcome.

This is just some random Math space quiz i made for a school project. 
Mainly i just wanted to try doing some html canvas animations using sin and cos to simulate a 2d orbit.
The questions themselves appear when you click the planets and then you just answer in a classic html manor and fill in a input and submit.
The question are just some random math questions i made up on the spot nothing special.
